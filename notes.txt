- Maybe it would be a good idea to have a separate Genome class for performing gene analytics, crossover operations, etc, rather than just storing everything in Organism?
- Gene values are always integers. If you want to have a GA that uses continuous gene values, you can just approximate it by using a large number of possible integers and then normalizing them to smaller fractional values.
